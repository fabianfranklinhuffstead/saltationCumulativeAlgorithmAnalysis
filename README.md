# SaltationCumulativeAlgorithmAnalysis

<p>A pure C solution for Data Structures and Algorithms with various stages of saltation and cumulative analysis written documentation of heuristic evaluations and Big O notation not included. Results for each are locate in the bin <a href="https://github.com/fabianfranklinhuffstead/saltationCumulativeAlgorithmAnalysis/tree/master/bin">here.</a> Alternatively run locally to gather your own results.</p>

<h2>The task: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Random genetic generation using <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/saltation">saltation</a> or <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cumulative">cumulative</a> algorithms</li>
  <li>Analysis and various stages of heuristic evaluation</li>
  <li>Original includes documentation explaining each behaviour, auto-runs self explanatory</li>
